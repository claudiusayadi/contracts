We propose a fully custom-built, responsive, and high-performance corporate website, 
hosted independently with open-source technologies on a self-managed VPS. This 
digital solution will replace the client's legacy WordPress site with modern web 
architecture.

The new site will embody modern UI/UX principles, optimal SEO structure, fast load 
times, and scalable architecture suitable for both business promotion and stakeholder 
engagement.
